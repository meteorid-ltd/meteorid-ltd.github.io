                <h3>About the Founder</h3>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Dr. Milos Sztipanov</strong> is the founder and lead scientist of meteorid ltd. 
                    He is a physicist who specializes in radiative transfer, bringing a rigorous analytical approach to scientific inquiry.
                    His expertise is in leveraging advanced computational tools—including <strong>Machine Learning, Python, FORTRAN, and high-performance computing</strong>—to translate abstract concepts into practical, innovative solutions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his recent role as a contract Physical Scientist at <strong>NOAA's National Weather Service (NCEP/EMC)</strong>, Dr. Sztipanov worked on improving the radiation scheme in the Unified Forecast System (UFS) weather models.
                    His work included formulating and developing a <strong>novel method for calculating atmospheric heating rates</strong> and pioneering research on a neural network to replace gas optics in the physical model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Sztipanov earned his <strong>Ph.D. in physics from Stevens Institute of Technology</strong>, where his research focused on methods for retrieving ozone, cloud, and aerosol properties utilizing machine learning and ground-based measurements. 
                    He holds a Bachelor's Degree in physics with a theoretical physics concentration from Eötvös Lóránd Science University (HUN). 
                    He continues to contribute to the field as a <strong>Visiting Researcher at Stevens Institute of Technology</strong> and a <strong>Research Associate at the University of Maryland</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His research has been published in numerous peer-reviewed journals, including the <strong><i>Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems</i>, <i>Atmosphere</i>, <i>Optics Express</i>, and <i>Applied Optics</i></strong>.
                </p>
